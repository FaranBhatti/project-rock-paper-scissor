# üè† Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Initial implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game.

This game is going to be played completely from the console (for now).

Winner is first one to 5. I didn't really implement any CSS and too much styling to it just basic styling. Was basically practice manipulating DOM using JS
